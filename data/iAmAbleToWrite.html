<h2>I am able to write</h2>
First edition on 2012 05(May) 21
Updated on 2012 05(May) 21 -

I haven't wrote for couple of days, this remind me of not been able to     <br>
write for couple of years. To be honest I panic a litte bit first, then I  <br>
thought why this happend to me? or better question was what if that happen <br>
again?                                                                     <br>

<h4>Spring season, Good internet connection and Freedom </h4>
  One of the reason that I am able to write, right now, it could be spring <br>
season. Spring season is next to the winter season (abviosly) and it seems <br>
by changing the environment, people change too     (abviosly).             <br>
I don't know how internet connection is connected to my mode of writing.   <br>
What I know is if I am not in a good mode of writing then there is high    <br>
chance of not having a good internet connection too.                       <br>
Freedom have levels (I think) and by writing something you could change    <br>
that level of freedom for yourself and/or for others.                      <br>
Well you may know why you (talking to myself) are able to write, right now.<br>

<h4>Writing for myself</h4>
  I am writing things down for myself. I founded it  useful when I have a  <br>
repeated task. For example once I wrote a post in my blog about using some <br>
software program in my current project. Later on I back to that post to use<br>
it for another project. Simply I was not able to remmeber required steps.  <br>
Another advantage for me is, it shows some of my thinking about particualr <br>
subject. And when I am backing to that subject in my future way then I     <br>
could use those forgotton points.                                          <br>

<h4>Is our mind a safe place for our thinking? </h4>
  We don't know about full potential of the brain. Some day maybe not far  <br>
we may find a way to use more of this potentail. Until that day I will use <br>
computer hard drive as an safe place to leave my thinking for my future    <br>
access.                                                                    <br>

<h4>Are you a software programmer?</h4>
  Not being able to write code will give me stronger panic. To give you an <br>
advise (talking to myself) since you are thinking about making a good      <br>
software, then you will be fine.                                           <br>

<h4>So what if that happen again?</h4>
  You will be fine since you are able to write code (making things).
